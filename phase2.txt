Preface:
We have created three accounts:


Username / Password
User1 / User1
User2 / User2
Admin / Admin
	

Login:


There are two user accounts and one admin account, you could use these accounts to login to this web-game. Also, you can always sign up to create a new account. Especially, the admin account will have a different function bar than the user account. Once login, you are able to see your balance, username, menu and profile. But, for the admin, you have a button called "VIEW ALL USER", which you could use to check all the user status.


User:


In the menu, you are able to go to different sites, such as store, your profile, and search other player
* In store: you can see different kinds of Pokemon to buy, and you could move your mouse to the pokemon picture, the pokemon will be selected and highlighted.

Pokemon Interact Page:


At the Profile page, you can select Pokemon to play with by clicking the DETAIL button on the Pokemon list. That will bring you to the interactive Pokemon page. You can earn money by playing with your Pokemon, you can level up your Pokemon to get even more money. Do remember to feed them when they are low in satiety and train them to obtain a massive amount of exp. As the level goes up, your Pokemon requires more experience and food to level up, however, they produce more money when the level is high. You can not play with your Pokemon when they are not lonely, or train them when they are hungry. Feeding your Pokemon will increase their satiety and when they are full you can heal them by keeping feeding, and the last, Pokemon gets a little experience when you feed them. Last but not least, some of the Pokemon would evolve when they reach a certain level. 
* You can only play with your Pokemon when loneliness is greater than 1. It will reduce loneliness of your Pokemon by 5, and reduce satiety by 2. It will produce 5 * (Pokemon’s level + 1) credits.
* You can only train your Pokemon when they have more than 5 satiety, they  will gain 50 experience and cost 5 credits. Also, your Pokemon’s loneliness will increase by 20.
* You can always feed your Pokemon when you have money. It costs 1 credits to feed them and they will gain 1 unit of satiety. When the Pokemon is full, it will heal for 1 hp. If the Pokemon is healthy and full, every time you feed them increase their experience by 1.
* When Pokemon levels up, their max satiety, experience, hp will double, however, it will produce more money when you play with it.
Trainer should train one of their Pokemon first in order to make more money. Feed them, train them and play with them.
